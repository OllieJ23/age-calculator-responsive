## Overview

This is an Age Calculator App made using React JS, formatted for web and mobile design. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) - For Date Calculations
- [Framer-Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - For Animation


### What I learned

I learned how to handle complex calculations and refine my ability to share states between components using React JS. 


### Continued development

In future, working on a mobile-first design might be more approachable, and allow me to refine my responsive design skills which i need practice on. 

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) - This really helped me to understand and breakdown some complex age calculations i struggled with, and design choices.
